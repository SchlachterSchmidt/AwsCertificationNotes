# What is EC2
- cloud computing power
- pay for capacity you actually use, not what you might eventually need


# EC2 options
- On Demand: fixed rate pay by the hour / second
- Reserved: capacity reservation on 1 to 3 year terms. Significantly reduced hourly charges
- Spot: bid on available capacity when start / end time of your job is flexible
- Dedicated hosts: physical server you rent in the AWS datacenter


# On Demand
- low cost flexibility
- no long term commitment


# Reserved Instance
- steady state and predictable usage
- pay upfront to reduce computing costs
  - up to 75% off on demand price
  - Convertivle RI: up to 54% off on demand price. Convert between instance types as long as the new type is of same or higher value
  - Scheduled Reserved instance: respond to predictable spikes


# Spot Instances
- flexible start and end time
- for applications that are only feasible at verly low costs


# Dedicated Hosts
- useful for regulated industries that cannot use multi-tennant virtualization and application with licensing that does not support cloud deployment
- on demand or Reserved


# Instance types
- different instance types have different optimizations for different workloads
- F -> FPGA
- I -> IOPS
- G -> Graphics
- H -> High Disk Throughput
- T -> general purpose (T2.micro)
- D -> Density
- R -> Ram
- M -> Main choice for general purpose
- C -> Compute
- p -> Graphics (Pics)
- X -> Extreme Memory


# EBS
- Elastic Block Storage
- Virtual hard drive to attach to an EC2 instance
- placed in a specific AZ, automatically replicated in case of physical disk failure
- root device volume is the device where the OS is installed


# EBS types
- GP2 -> General purpose SSD
  - up to 10k IOPS
- IO1 -> Provisioned IOPS SSD
  - designed for I/O intensive applications such as databases
  - use if you need more that 10k IOPS
- ST1 -> Throughput optimized HDD
  - cannot be a root device
  - for big data, logs, data warehouse
- SC1 -> Cold HDD
  - lowest cost for infrequently accessed workloads
- Magnetic (Standard)
  - lowest cost per gigabyte
  - bootable
  - infrequently accessed data


# Tips
- Pricing Models
  - On Demand -> pay by the second / hour
  - Reserved -> capacity reservation, significant discount on On Demand pricee, 1 - 3 year terms
  - Spot -> bidding
    - if spot instance is terminated while using (because the price went up) you are not charged for the partial hour
  - Dedicated Hosts -> rent physical device in AWS datacenter
- Mnemonic: FIGHTDRMCPIX for instance types
- EBS types:
  - SSD:
    - General Purpose, up to 10k IOPS
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD -> Over 10K IOPS
  - Magnetic
    - Throughput optimized
    - Cold HDD
    - Magnetic -> only bootable magnetic device
