# S3 basics
- Place to store data
- Object storage where you can upload files up to 5TB in size
- pay by the GB, storage is unlimited
- storage organized around bucket
  - bucket have a unique name globally
  - bucket name forms the URL
  - url look like
    https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
- build for 99.9 availability, SLA is 99.9
- Amazon guarantee 11 9's for durability (data loss)
- tiered storage available
- lifecycle management
- versioning
- Encryption
- secure data using Access Conrol Lists and Bucket Policies


# Data consistency model
- read after write for PUT on create
- eventual consistency for PUT on update and DELETE
  - S3 is spread across AZs so it can take time to propagate across AZs


# S3 is a K-V store
- key is the name of the object
- value is the data that is stored
- version ID
- Metadata
- subresources
  - access control list
  - Torrent


# S3 storage tiers

  - enables fast, easy, secure transfer of files from S3 to the end user
  - uses edge locations


# Tips
- object based, not DB

- S3 is a universal namespace
- URL: https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucketname>
- read after write for create using PUT
- eventual consistency for updates
- Standard, IA, One Zone - IA, Glacier
